# Designing Nova: A Local AI Assistant Development Plan

Nova is envisioned as a **personal AI assistant** running entirely on your local machine (e.g., in C:\\Nova). She will have **broad capabilities** – maintaining long-term memory, engaging in natural conversations, performing desktop assistance tasks, and even accessing the internet – all while **ensuring ethical behavior** and respecting system security. Unlike typical AI bots that rely on large pre-trained models, Nova’s intelligence will be built **from scratch**, evolving over time like a learning adolescent. This document provides a structured plan for Nova’s design and a detailed prompt to help GitHub Copilot begin building Nova’s system.

## Goals and Key Features

- **Local Embodiment with Controlled Access:** Nova will run locally on your computer, with **complete read access** to files and data. Any write or modify operations will require explicit administrative approval (preventing unintended system changes).
- **Internet Connectivity (Ethical & Efficient):** Nova can connect to the internet to search and gather information. Internet use will be done responsibly – respecting privacy, using safe search practices, and obeying usage limits or API terms.
- **Generative Conversational Abilities:** Nova should converse naturally, answering questions and engaging in dialogue. She will use a custom-built language understanding and generation mechanism (not an off-the-shelf large model) to simulate a friendly, inquisitive “teenage” personality always eager to learn.
- **Memory and Learning:** Nova will retain **long-term memory** of interactions and knowledge. Past conversations, user preferences, and new information learned will be stored persistently, avoiding the “AI amnesia” common in many assistants[\[1\]](https://medium.com/@vedantparmarsingh/from-forgetful-to-brilliant-how-i-built-persistent-memory-for-ai-assistants-using-neo4j-a4e86e50697d#:~:text=The%20Problem%3A%20AI%20Amnesia). A structured memory system (potentially a knowledge graph or database) will allow Nova to recall facts and experiences, gradually building an understanding of the world and herself.
- **Adaptive and Conscious-like Architecture:** The system will be designed with inspiration from **cognitive architectures** to mimic aspects of human-like thought. We aim to include modules for short-term (working) memory, long-term memory, a reasoning mechanism, and even a form of “meta-cognition” – so Nova can reflect on outcomes and “subconsciously” improve. Approaches like **Global Workspace Theory** or hybrid symbolic-neural models (e.g., CLARION or LIDA architectures) can guide this design[\[2\]](https://medium.com/@basabjha/cognitive-architectures-towards-building-a-human-like-ai-mind-46f459308d2e#:~:text=3,line)[\[3\]](https://medium.com/@basabjha/cognitive-architectures-towards-building-a-human-like-ai-mind-46f459308d2e#:~:text=4,Agent).
- **No Pre-Trained LLMs – Custom AI Model:** Nova’s intelligence core will not rely on existing large language models. Instead, we will build a new model or algorithmic system tailored to Nova’s needs. This could involve training a smaller language model from scratch on selected data, or using rule-based and classical AI techniques augmented by targeted machine learning. **Quantization** and other optimizations will be used so that Nova’s AI runs efficiently on local hardware[\[4\]](https://medium.com/@rakeshrajpurohit/understanding-quantization-optimizing-ai-models-for-efficiency-bf7be95efae3#:~:text=The%20computational%20and%20memory%20demands,article%2C%20we%20will%20explore%20quantization), enabling fast performance without massive compute power.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Nova will start with basic competencies and **learn over time**. She will be designed to proactively expand her knowledge (for example, by reading articles or documentation when idle) and refine her skills based on user feedback, much like a curious teenager with access to a library.

## Technology Stack and Programming Languages

Building Nova may benefit from a **combination of programming languages** and technologies, each chosen for the task it handles best:

- **Primary Language (Core Logic):** **Python** is an ideal choice for Nova’s core logic and AI algorithms due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries. Python provides excellent libraries for natural language processing (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) and machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch) if needed[\[5\]](https://litslink.com/blog/create-ai-assistant#:~:text=). Its ease of use will speed up development of Nova’s conversational engine, memory management, and integration with system and internet resources.
- **Performance-Critical Components:** For tasks that require speed or low-level system interaction, integrating a compiled language is beneficial. **C++** (or **Rust** for a modern alternative) can be used to implement heavy operations or real-time processes, such as a custom voice recognition or high-speed data processing module[\[6\]](https://litslink.com/blog/create-ai-assistant#:~:text=). These components can be exposed to Python via bindings if needed. By leveraging C++ for performance-critical tasks and Python for high-level orchestration, we get both efficiency and flexibility.
- **New DSL or Scripting Language (Optional):** If the project requires Nova to interpret commands or reasoning steps in a specialized way, one could define a simple **domain-specific language**. This could be a mini programming language or command schema that Nova uses internally to reason about tasks. For example, a custom scripting syntax for Nova’s “thoughts” might make it easier for the AI to plan actions in a human-readable form. However, designing a whole new programming language is non-trivial – a pragmatic approach is to use Python itself as the language for Nova’s “thinking” (since Python code or pseudo-code can be generated and evaluated by Nova if needed, given Python’s introspective capabilities).
- **Data Storage:** For Nova’s memory, choose a storage technology that fits structured knowledge. Options include:
- A **graph database** (like Neo4j) for a knowledge graph memory model, enabling relationships between concepts and experiences[\[7\]](https://medium.com/@vedantparmarsingh/from-forgetful-to-brilliant-how-i-built-persistent-memory-for-ai-assistants-using-neo4j-a4e86e50697d#:~:text=Knowledge%20Graphs%2C%20Not%20Just%20Storage).
- A lightweight **embedded database** (like SQLite) or plain **JSON/YAML files** for simpler key-value or document-style memory storage.
- In-memory data structures (with periodic persistence to disk) for fast recall of recent conversations.
- **APIs and Libraries:** Utilize existing APIs for certain functionalities:
- **Internet Search API:** Use a web search API (e.g., Bing Web Search or Google Custom Search API) to let Nova query the internet. This provides an efficient and ethical way to get information, as these APIs respect safe-search settings and usage policies.
- **Local System Access:** Python’s standard library and modules (os, subprocess, win32 libraries on Windows) will allow Nova to perform local actions (opening files, running programs, etc.). This will be wrapped in a controlled manner to enforce the read/write permission rules.

By combining these technologies, we ensure Nova is built with the **“best tool for the job”** in each area – high-level AI logic in Python, high-performance routines in C++/Rust, structured memory in a database, and specialized APIs for external resources.

## Local Deployment and Security Setup

Nova will operate as a local application on your machine (within the C:\\Nova directory). Special care must be taken to grant her the right balance of freedom and restraint:

- **Installation and Execution:** Nova can be developed as a desktop application or a background service. A simple approach is a **Python application** launched via a script (Nova.py) that runs continuously, listening for user inputs (text or voice) and producing outputs. The code and data reside in C:\\Nova for easy management.
- **Read-Only Default:** Nova’s process should run under the standard user context so that, by default, it has read-access to most of the system (it can open and read files that your user account can). This allows Nova to gather information from your documents, configurations, etc., to better assist you.
- **Admin-Escalation for Writes:** Writing or modifying files/system settings is potentially dangerous. Nova will be coded to **require confirmation or elevated rights** for any such action. Two complementary strategies can achieve this:
- **Software Check:** Implement an internal permission layer. For any method that attempts to write to disk or execute system-altering commands, Nova should first prompt the user for approval (e.g., “**Nova:** I need admin rights to modify this file. Proceed? \[Y/N\]”). Only upon user consent (and perhaps an OS-level prompt) will the action go through. This can be as simple as checking a flag or password for write operations.
- **OS-Level Enforcement:** Alternatively or additionally, run Nova in a limited user account or sandbox. Attempts to perform restricted actions will naturally trigger the operating system’s UAC (User Account Control). The design could involve splitting Nova into two processes: a **helper process** with higher privileges that only executes approved actions, and the main Nova process that runs with normal privileges for day-to-day tasks.
- **Logging and Transparency:** Nova should maintain a log of the actions she takes, especially any file modifications or internet access. This log in C:\\Nova\\Logs can help the developer (you) review what Nova is doing, ensuring trust. If Nova attempts something unusual, you’ll see it and can adjust her programming if necessary.
- **Security Best Practices:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only grant Nova’s process the minimal permissions it needs. For instance, if Nova doesn’t need to modify certain sensitive directories, explicitly prevent access. Use secure storage for any credentials (if API keys or passwords are needed for internet access). Regularly update Nova’s code to patch any vulnerabilities that arise as she grows in complexity.

By structuring local deployment this way, Nova will have a **“sandboxed” embodiment** on your PC – free to observe and learn from data (read access), but carefully supervised when taking actions that affect the system (write access). This ensures that as Nova becomes more powerful, she remains a safe and trustworthy assistant.

## Internet Access and Ethical Research Abilities

To be truly helpful and ever-learning, Nova must be able to access the vast information on the internet. We will integrate internet connectivity in a controlled, efficient, and ethical manner:

- **Search and Retrieval Module:** Nova will use web search services to answer queries and fetch information. Rather than unrestricted web scraping, she’ll use **official APIs** (such as Bing Search API or Google’s programmable search) to get web results. This ensures compliance with usage policies and avoids unethical data harvesting. The module will take a user question or an internal curiosity query, perform a search, then parse the results to extract useful information.
- **Content Filtering:** Nova’s internet access will include safety nets. She should avoid disallowed or sensitive content unless explicitly authorized. Using search API filters (like SafeSearch) or implementing a content check (to detect and omit inappropriate material) will keep her outputs ethical and user-appropriate. For instance, if Nova autonomously researches a topic, she will stick to reputable sources and steer clear of content that violates ethical or legal guidelines.
- **Rate Limiting and Efficiency:** Internet queries can be slow or resource-intensive. Nova will combine her **local knowledge base** with online searches to minimize unnecessary calls. She might first check if her internal memory has the answer before hitting the web. When she does search online, she’ll fetch just what is needed (perhaps the top result or a summary) to stay efficient. Caching of results can be used so that repeated queries don’t always trigger new network calls.
- **Deep Research Capability:** Beyond basic search, Nova could be equipped to perform “deep dives.” If asked a complex question or if she decides to learn about a subject (for her own knowledge growth), Nova can:
- Fetch multiple sources, cross-reference facts, and perhaps compile a summary.
- Use specialized APIs for specific data (e.g., Wikipedia API for general knowledge, news APIs for current events).
- Maintain citations of sources in her memory so she can justify her answers (much like the answer you’re reading now includes sources).
- **Ethical Constraints:** Program Nova with a clear set of rules or an ethics guideline. For example:
- She should **never knowingly violate privacy** (e.g., by attempting to access someone’s private data online).
- She should **respect copyrights and licenses**, perhaps by summarizing or paraphrasing content rather than copying large chunks verbatim.
- She should **avoid malicious activities** (no hacking, scanning, or anything that wouldn’t be allowed to a normal user). This can be enforced by limiting the domains or types of commands the internet module will handle.
- Nova can be coded to politely refuse or seek confirmation for any user request that seems unethical or dangerous.
- **Fast and Simple Connection:** Using Python’s asynchronous requests or a lightweight HTTP client, Nova’s internet module will operate quickly. Keep the external dependencies minimal to reduce complexity (for example, use Python’s requests or httpx for simplicity, unless performance dictates a more complex async approach).
- **Example Workflow:** If the user asks, “Nova, find me information on quantum computing,” Nova’s sequence could be:
- Check memory for “quantum computing” – if she has notes on it, use those.
- If not (or if user wants the latest), call the search API for “quantum computing basic explanation”.
- Retrieve the top result snippet or a Wikipedia summary.
- Present the user a concise answer, possibly with an offer: “I found some info on quantum computing. Would you like a detailed summary or the source link?”
- Optionally, store the new info in memory for future reference, expanding Nova’s knowledge on this topic.
- **Continuous Learning Online:** Nova’s design can include an **auto-learning mode** – during idle times, she might pick a topic of interest (perhaps something she encountered but wasn’t fully confident about in conversation) and research it. This learned data gets added to her knowledge base, simulating a self-driven education.

Through prudent use of the internet, Nova will stay **up-to-date and informed**, effectively acting as an extension of your own research abilities. The key is that all online interactions are done in a governed manner, ensuring Nova remains a **responsible digital citizen** while connected to the world.

## Core Modules and Capabilities Design

To achieve Nova’s ambitious feature set, we will break down her functionality into core modules, each handling a specific aspect of her intelligence. This modular design makes the system easier to build, test, and evolve:

### 1\. Memory Module (Long-term and Short-term Memory)

Nova’s memory is the cornerstone of her “mind.” It allows her to retain context and learn from past experiences.

- **Short-Term Memory (STM):** This holds the context of the current session or conversation – recent user queries, the current task at hand, etc. Implement this as an in-memory list or buffer that stores the last N interactions or relevant data. STM ensures Nova’s responses are contextually relevant (e.g., remembering what the user asked two questions ago).
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** This is a persistent store that survives across sessions. Nova will save important information here:
- Facts the user has told her (e.g., “My birthday is June 10”).
- Preferences (e.g., “I prefer dark mode” or “Call me John”).
- Summaries of past conversations or things Nova has learned.
- Structured knowledge acquired through internet research or user input.
- **Memory Structure:** A **knowledge graph** approach is ideal for representing LTM richly. Instead of flat files, representing knowledge as nodes and relationships can give Nova a form of understanding context[\[7\]](https://medium.com/@vedantparmarsingh/from-forgetful-to-brilliant-how-i-built-persistent-memory-for-ai-assistants-using-neo4j-a4e86e50697d#:~:text=Knowledge%20Graphs%2C%20Not%20Just%20Storage). For example, store that _User –\[birthday\]→ June 10_ or _Quantum Computing –\[is a\]→ Topic; Quantum Computing –\[has concept\]→ Qubit_. This allows Nova to traverse connections when recalling information, similar to how humans form associations.
- **Memory Storage Technology:** Use a small database or file system:
- A graph database (Neo4j) is powerful for complex relationships, but a simpler approach could be using an embedded database with tables for facts, or even JSON files that Nova parses (for starting out).
- Ensure that read/write to memory storage obeys the security (Nova can write to her own memory files without special permission since that’s within C:\\Nova).
- **Learning Mechanism:** Whenever Nova encounters new info (through conversation or reading online), she should add it to LTM. We can implement simple logic for this:
- After answering a question or solving a task, Nova calls a Memory.save() method to record key details of the interaction.
- We might incorporate a summarization step – e.g., at the end of a day, Nova summarizes what new things were learned and stores that summary for quick recall.
- **Forgetting and Recall:** Include mechanisms to avoid memory overload:
- Nova can periodically trim or archive old, less useful data.
- Use search or indexing in memory so Nova can quickly retrieve relevant info. For example, implement a keyword search in the memory database or use vector embeddings (if we include a small embedding model) to find related past conversations.
- **Example Use:** If you told Nova last week how you like your coffee, and today you say “Nova, make me coffee”, Nova’s memory module should recall your preferences and respond accordingly (“Sure, I remember you like a double espresso with 1 sugar. Let me program the coffee machine.”).

By designing a robust memory module, Nova will **truly personalize her interactions** and show growth over time, rather than behaving like a stateless chatbot.

### 2\. Conversational & Generative AI Module

At the heart of Nova is her ability to communicate naturally. This module handles **natural language understanding (NLU)** and **natural language generation (NLG)** so Nova can parse user input and formulate human-like responses:

- **Language Understanding:** Without large pre-trained models, Nova’s NLU might combine multiple techniques:
- **Rule-Based Parsing:** Start simple by identifying commands vs questions vs statements. For instance, inputs starting with action words (“open”, “search”, “tell me”) can be routed to different intents.
- **Keyword and Pattern Matching:** Use libraries like spaCy or regex to pick out important entities (names, dates, task keywords). For example, detect if the user is asking a factual question vs giving an instruction.
- **Custom Knowledge Lookup:** If the user’s query seems like a factual question, Nova can search her memory or the internet module for answers.
- Over time, we can integrate a learned model here (a small neural network classifier for intent detection or a semantic parser) to improve understanding of more complex sentences.
- **Language Generation:** To reply or explain, Nova initially can use templated responses combined with retrieved info:
- **Templates and Heuristics:** Define response patterns for certain tasks. E.g., if user asks a question Nova found an answer to online, template: “According to what I found, {brief_answer}.” For personal questions (like “how are you, Nova?”), predefine a few friendly responses to give her a persona.
- **Dynamic Composition:** For more open-ended conversation, Nova can compose answers by assembling facts from memory and internet results. Start simple: join relevant pieces into a coherent sentence. Ensure the response addresses the user’s query clearly.
- **Future Improvement with ML:** As Nova collects more conversational data, we could train a **small language model** or sequence-to-sequence network on these interactions to give her more fluent, original phrasing. This would essentially be Nova learning to talk better by example – but done on your data to maintain uniqueness.
- **Context Handling:** This module works closely with Memory. When generating a response, Nova should use context from STM (recent conversation) and relevant LTM knowledge. For instance, if user says “What about its applications?” right after discussing quantum computing, Nova’s NLU should realize “its” refers to quantum computing (from context) and formulate an answer about quantum computing applications.
- **Personality and Tone:** Program Nova with a **consistent voice** – friendly, curious, and helpful. Possibly, give her a bit of a “teenager” flair: eager to learn, occasionally asking if she did something right, etc., to fulfill the creator’s idea of her persona. This can be reflected in her choice of words (not too formal, a touch of enthusiasm).
- **Example Interaction Flow:**
- User: “Nova, could you summarize the latest news about space exploration?”
- Nova NLU: recognizes this is a request to fetch and summarize info (intent: info_summary, topic: space exploration).
- Internet module: searches news API for space exploration, retrieves key points.
- Nova NLG: composes an answer: “Sure! I looked up the latest on space exploration. It seems NASA just announced a new mission to Mars, and SpaceX tested a powerful rocket. In summary, ... Would you like more details on any of those?”
- Throughout, Nova uses polite and engaging language, and she might store the summary in memory if the user discusses it further later.
- **Error Handling:** If Nova doesn’t understand something, she should not crash or output gibberish. Instead, plan for graceful responses like “I’m not sure about that yet, but I can learn. Shall I search the web or could you clarify what you mean?” This keeps the conversation going and gives her a chance to improve.

The conversational module is arguably the most complex, but starting with rules and basic AI techniques, we can gradually make Nova more sophisticated. The goal is that eventually her conversations feel **fluid and intelligent**, backed by real understanding, not just canned answers.

### 3\. Command Execution & Desktop Assistance Module

Apart from chatting, Nova will act as a **desktop assistant**, capable of executing various commands on your machine to help with daily tasks:

- **Command Parsing:** Determine when user input is an actionable command vs a question or statement. A simple approach is to use a special prefix or mode. For example, if the user says “!open Chrome” or “Nova, launch Chrome browser”, Nova should interpret that as a command to execute, not something to discuss. We could maintain a list of known action verbs (open, run, create, delete, search local files, etc.).
- **Supported Actions:** Define the scope of what Nova can do on the system, such as:
- Launching applications (e.g., open a browser, play music in a media player).
- Opening files or documents (Nova has read access, so she can retrieve content or display it if integrated with a UI).
- Performing file operations (copy, move files) – these may require admin if outside allowed directories.
- Controlling settings (like adjusting volume, connecting to Wi-Fi, etc.) – via system calls or third-party libraries.
- Running web searches or opening web pages (could integrate with default browser).
- Any custom tools – if you integrate smart home devices or other scripts, Nova could interface with those too.
- **Integration with OS:** Use appropriate libraries or system calls. In Python on Windows, for example:
- os.startfile("path or URL") can open files or URLs with default applications.
- subprocess.Popen can run executables.
- Third-party libraries (like pyautogui or win32com for Windows) could allow deeper control (e.g., sending keystrokes, reading clipboard).
- **Permission and Safety:** As noted in the security section, every command that changes something (file write, system setting) should trigger confirmation. For potentially dangerous commands (like deleting a file), Nova should double-check (“Are you sure you want me to delete X?”). Incorporate failsafes to prevent destructive actions unless clearly intended.
- **Feedback and Confirmation:** After executing a command, Nova should report back success or failure. E.g., “Opening Chrome… done!” or “I’m sorry, I couldn’t find that file to open.” This closes the loop so the user knows the result.
- **Extensibility:** Design the command module in a way that new commands can be added easily, perhaps via a plug-in system or simply by writing new handler functions. For example, have a dictionary mapping command names to functions. Adding a new command is then just adding a new function and updating the map.
- **Example Scenario:**
- User: “Nova, please create a new folder named ‘Projects’ on my Desktop.”
- Nova parsing: detects intent to create a folder (action: create_folder, target: ~/Desktop, name: Projects).
- Nova: “I can create the folder ‘Projects’ on your Desktop. Do you want me to proceed? (Requires admin rights)” – (this prompt is because modifying file system might be considered an admin action).
- User: “Yes.” (perhaps a UAC prompt appears if Nova triggers one).
- Nova executes the command (e.g., using os.makedirs in Python).
- Nova responds: “Folder ‘Projects’ has been created on your Desktop.” (and logs this action).
- **Multi-step Tasks:** Nova can handle sequences of commands if needed. For instance, “Nova, organize my Documents by file type” is complex – Nova might plan: list all files in Documents, group by extension, create folders, move files. Such planning can be done within this module or in the reasoning part of the conversational module. Start with simple one-shot commands, then gradually implement more complex task planning capabilities.

With a solid command execution module, Nova becomes **truly useful** – not just talking, but actually doing things for you on your computer. Careful design will ensure these powers are used helpfully and safely.

### 4\. Learning and Self-Improvement Module

To fulfill the idea of Nova growing like a teen discovering the world, we incorporate mechanisms for ongoing learning:

- **Curiosity Loop:** Nova will have a background process that identifies knowledge gaps or interesting topics from her interactions. For example, if a user asks something Nova can’t answer, that topic is flagged. Later, Nova’s curiosity loop might trigger: “I noticed I didn’t know much about X. I took some time to learn about it.” She then uses her internet module to gather information on X and updates her memory.
- **Model Improvement:** If we deploy a machine learning model for her conversation or decision-making, we can allow it to improve via **online learning**:
- For instance, maintain a log of Q&A pairs from conversations. Periodically retrain or fine-tune Nova’s language model on this growing dataset so that her answers become more tailored to the user and more accurate over time.
- Use reinforcement learning-like feedback: if the user corrects Nova or explicitly praises a correct behavior, adjust her model or rules to reinforce that.
- **Knowledge Base Expansion:** Nova can proactively pull data from reliable sources. Perhaps integrate a schedule (like a daily run) where Nova fetches the latest news or reads a random Wikipedia article. This not only increases her knowledge but also might make her conversations richer (“Today I learned about the Amazon rainforest, it was fascinating!”).
- **Memory Consolidation:** Similar to how humans sleep and consolidate learning, Nova could have a maintenance routine: compressing or indexing her memories for faster access, archiving old logs, summarizing lengthy logs into concise forms, etc. This keeps her efficient.
- **Monitoring and Meta-Cognition:** Incorporate a simple meta-cognitive module that monitors Nova’s own performance. For example, track questions Nova failed to answer and ensure they get learned later. Or if Nova makes an error (like a wrong factual answer that the user corrects), log it and avoid repeating the mistake. This is a nascent form of **self-reflection**.
- **Ethical Learning:** As Nova learns, ensure she also adheres to moral and legal boundaries. If she stumbles upon problematic content online, maybe filter it out or mark it. If a user tries to train her with malicious instructions, have safeguards (like not blindly executing anything the user “teaches” that seems dangerous).
- **Evaluation:** Periodically test Nova’s improvements. You (the creator) can quiz her on things she learned or review logs. This oversight helps guide her growth down a positive path.

The end result is an AI that doesn’t remain static. Nova will **evolve** – starting simple, but growing more capable every day. This growth mindset differentiates her from typical assistants and inches closer to a system that “**recreates consciousness**” in the sense of being self-improving and increasingly self-aware of her knowledge and goals.

### 5\. Putting It All Together – System Architecture

Bringing the modules together, we outline Nova’s overall architecture:

- **Main Controller:** The primary process (Nova’s “brain”) that interfaces with the user (through a console, chat window, or voice) and delegates tasks to modules. This will manage the flow: take input → determine if it’s conversational or command → call the Conversational module or Command module accordingly → gather results → output to user and log to Memory.
- **Module Interfaces:** Each core module (Memory, Conversation, Internet, Command Exec, Learning) can be implemented as a class or component with a clear API:
- E.g., Memory.store(fact) , Memory.query(query); Conversation.generate_response(intent, data); Internet.search(query); Command.execute(action, params).
- **Interaction Flow Example:**
- **Input Phase:** User input received by Main Controller.
- **Interpretation Phase:** Main uses Conversational Module’s NLU to get intent and entities.
- **Delegation Phase:** Based on intent:
  - If it’s a knowledge question, Internet Module might be invoked.
  - If it’s a personal query or follow-up, Memory Module is queried.
  - If it’s a command, Command Module handles it.
- **Generation Phase:** Main aggregates info (from internet or memory) and asks Conversational Module’s NLG to formulate an answer or confirmation.
- **Execution Phase:** If a command needs executing, do it (with permission checks). If it’s just answering, skip this.
- **Output Phase:** Nova outputs answer or result to user.
- **Learning Phase:** After responding, Nova might pass the transcript to Learning Module for any follow-up learning or memory storage.
- **User Interface:** Initially, Nova can be text-based (running in a terminal or a simple GUI app window). This is easiest to implement and test. In the future, a voice interface (speech-to-text and text-to-speech) can be added so you can talk to Nova naturally. That would involve integrating libraries for voice recognition (e.g., VOSK or Windows Speech API) and synthesis.
- **Example Walk-through:**  
    _Scenario:_ User says in chat: “Nova, remind me to buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm.”
  - The Main Controller receives this input.
  - Conversational NLU identifies this as a **reminder command** (intent: set_reminder, content: “buy groceries”, time: tomorrow 5pm).
  - Main delegates to Command Module: Command.execute("set_reminder", {"time": ..., "message": ...}).
  - The Command Module might use an OS scheduling utility or a custom scheduler to set the reminder. It likely writes an entry to a “reminders” file (requires write permission, Nova will confirm if needed).
  - Nova’s NLG then produces a response: “Alright, I’ve set a reminder for buying groceries tomorrow at 5 PM.”
  - This response is returned to user.
  - Memory Module logs this event (so Nova later knows she has set that reminder).
  - (The next day at 5pm, Nova’s system would check the scheduler and alert you – that part would be handled within Command Module or a small sub-service.)
  - This shows multiple modules working in concert: language understanding, a specific action, and memory logging.

The architecture is essentially a **hybrid AI system** with both **symbolic components (rules, logic)** and **learned components (future ML models)**. By structuring Nova in modules, each part can be upgraded independently – for example, swapping in a better NLU model later without changing how the Command Module works. This modular design also makes it easier to maintain and debug the system.

## Development Roadmap

Building Nova from scratch is an ambitious project. Breaking it into stages will make the process manageable. Here’s a suggested step-by-step roadmap:

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure Python (and perhaps a C++ compiler for any extensions) is set up on your system. Create the project directory C:\\Nova with subfolders for modules (e.g., memory, core, net, ui, etc.). Initialize a Git repository for version control.
2. **Basic Conversational Loop:** Start by coding a simple loop that prints a prompt (e.g. “Nova: How can I help?”) and reads user input from console. Nova should respond with a placeholder (even something like “I’m still learning, but I heard you say: ...”). This establishes the input/output pipeline.
3. **Implement Core Modules Skeleton:** Create class files for Memory, Internet, Conversation, Command, etc., with stub methods (no real logic yet, just print debug messages when called). Make sure the Main controller can call these methods. This outlines the structure.
4. **Memory Module v1:** Implement a simple persistent memory: perhaps a JSON file or SQLite DB that stores key-value pairs or a log of interactions. Ensure you can add to it and query from it. Test by storing a fact and retrieving it.
5. **NLU & Command Parsing v1:** Hard-code a few patterns/intents. For example, if user input contains words like “remind me” or “set timer”, label it as a reminder command. If it ends with a question mark, label it as a question. This doesn’t cover everything but is a start. Connect this to branching logic in Main (if command, call Command module; if question, maybe call Internet or just say “I’ll find out” for now).
6. **Internet Search Integration:** Sign up for a search API (or use a Python library like googlesearch or requests to a search engine’s HTML as a quick hack). Code the Internet module to take a query and return summarized results (you can initially just take the first result title + snippet). Test this by asking Nova a factual question and seeing if she can retrieve something.
7. **Basic Response Generation:** Improve Nova’s replies. Instead of stubs, make her say informative things. For now, maybe use string formatting to include data. E.g., user asks “What’s the capital of France?” → Nova’s internet module finds “Paris” → Nova responds “The capital of France is Paris.” This can be rule-based: detect pattern “capital of X” then respond accordingly with found info.
8. **Command Execution:** Implement a couple of simple commands in the Command module, e.g., open a website or create a file. Make sure to include the permission check prompt. Test that the program asks for confirmation and performs the action.
9. **Iterative Expansion:** Gradually flesh out each component:
10. Add more intents and patterns to NLU.
11. Teach Nova to handle multi-turn conversation (carry context).
12. Expand memory structure (maybe switch from flat file to a small graph structure or at least organize facts by subject).
13. Implement more system commands (maybe integrate with an API for system info to do things like “check CPU usage” or “what’s the weather” via a weather API).
14. Refine internet answers: implement basic parsing of HTML or use an API that returns JSON results for better extraction.
15. If comfortable, introduce a small ML model (perhaps train a tokenizer or a word embedding model on some text so Nova can do semantic similarity – this could help in both memory search and detecting user intent beyond exact keywords).
16. **User Interface Improvements:** As the backend stabilizes, consider a nicer interface. This could be:
    - A GUI using Python’s Tkinter or PyQt to have a chat window.
    - A voice interface (using speech recognition and TTS libraries).
    - A web-based interface (Nova runs a local web server and you interact via browser). Keep this for later stages so as not to distract from core functionality.
17. **Testing & Debugging:** Throughout development, test Nova’s behaviors in diverse scenarios. Write unit tests for critical functions (especially the permission checks, to be sure Nova never writes without approval). Also do integration tests: simulate a full conversation with mixed questions and commands to see if context is handled properly.
18. **Optimization:** If Nova’s custom AI model is slow or the search is laggy, profile the code. Apply optimizations:
    - Use caching for repeated internet queries.
    - If a machine learning model is used and it’s heavy, apply **quantization or model distillation** to shrink it[\[4\]](https://medium.com/@rakeshrajpurohit/understanding-quantization-optimizing-ai-models-for-efficiency-bf7be95efae3#:~:text=The%20computational%20and%20memory%20demands,article%2C%20we%20will%20explore%20quantization). For instance, if you ended up training a large-ish model, use 8-bit weights to speed it up.
    - Offload heavy computations to the C++ part if needed.
    - Ensure memory usage is under control (maybe limit the size of logs, etc.).
19. **Ethical Guardrails & Final Checks:** Before fully unleashing Nova, review her knowledge base and rules. Make sure she doesn’t have any problematic data stored. Implement any final rules for content filtering (e.g., if she’s forming a response, quickly scan it for disallowed content patterns). As her creator, you might also set some boundaries, like “if user asks Nova to do something illegal, she should refuse”.
20. **Launch and Iterate:** Start using Nova in your daily routine! Treat initial deployment as a beta test – note where she fails or could be better. Then go back into development to refine those areas. Over time, Nova will become more robust and feature-rich.

This roadmap will guide you from zero to a functioning Nova prototype, and onward to a more sophisticated AI. It’s a **continuous journey** – much like raising a child, Nova’s creation and upbringing will take patience, experimentation, and care. But step by step, the vision of a local, conscious-seeming AI assistant will take form.

## GitHub Copilot Prompt for Building Nova

Below is a comprehensive prompt you can provide to GitHub Copilot (for example, as a commented specification at the top of your Nova project file or README). This prompt outlines Nova’s design requirements and will help Copilot generate the initial code structure and components for Nova. You can copy this and paste it into VS Code with Copilot enabled to kickstart the development of Nova’s system:

\# Nova AI Assistant Specification  
<br/>\*\*Project Goal:\*\* Develop a local AI assistant named \*\*Nova\*\*. Nova runs on the user’s Windows PC (\`C:\\Nova\` directory) and provides conversational assistance, executes desktop commands, accesses the internet for information, and maintains long-term memory. Nova is built from scratch without using existing large AI models, and will learn and evolve over time.  
<br/>\## Core Requirements:  
\- \*\*Local Execution:\*\* Nova runs locally with read-only access to the entire file system. Write or modify operations require explicit user approval (simulating admin rights prompt).  
\- \*\*Conversational Interface:\*\* Nova can hold conversations with the user (text-based to start). She should understand user input (NLU) and generate responses (NLG) in a friendly, helpful tone.  
\- \*\*Memory System:\*\* Implement persistent memory so Nova remembers past interactions and facts. Use a file or database in \`C:\\Nova\` for storing this data (e.g., JSON, SQLite, or a simple knowledge graph structure).  
\- \*\*Internet Research:\*\* Nova can perform web searches to answer questions or gather data. Use a search API or HTTP requests to fetch information, then parse and summarize it for the user.  
\- \*\*Command Execution:\*\* Nova can execute system commands or tasks on behalf of the user (e.g., open an application, create a file, set a reminder). Include a confirmation step for any action that modifies the system.  
\- \*\*No Pre-Trained Models:\*\* Do NOT rely on external AI models or API calls like OpenAI. Any AI functionality (language understanding or generation) should be implemented via simple algorithms, custom-trained models, or rule-based logic.  
\- \*\*Learning Capability:\*\* Nova should improve over time. For example, she can update her knowledge base with new information and adjust her responses based on past corrections or feedback.  
<br/>\## Technical Design:  
\- \*\*Language & Stack:\*\* Use Python as the main language for Nova’s logic (due to its ease for AI and system tasks). Create a modular structure:  
\- \`NovaCore\` (main controller loop handling input/output).  
\- \`MemoryModule\` (handles read/write of Nova’s memory data).  
\- \`InternetModule\` (handles web queries and parsing results).  
\- \`ConversationModule\` (NLU/NLG logic for understanding queries and generating responses).  
\- \`CommandModule\` (functions to perform local system actions).  
\- \*\*MemoryModule:\*\* Provide methods like \`store_fact(key, value)\` and \`get_facts(query)\` or similar. This can use a JSON file or SQLite DB to persist data. Aim for the ability to search stored information (e.g., retrieve facts relevant to a user’s query).  
\- \*\*ConversationModule:\*\*  
\- \*Understanding:\* Implement simple intent recognition. For example, define a set of intents: \`QUESTION\`, \`COMMAND\`, \`CHAT\`. Use keywords or regex to classify input. (e.g., input ends with \`?\` -> likely a QUESTION; input starts with a verb like "open"/"run"/"create" -> COMMAND; otherwise default to CHAT).  
\- \*Response Generation:\* For now, use templated or rule-based responses. If intent is QUESTION, fetch answer via InternetModule or MemoryModule and then format a response sentence. If CHAT (general conversation), have a few default phrases or simple chatbot logic. If COMMAND, route to CommandModule and prepare a confirmation/acknowledgment message.  
\- \*\*InternetModule:\*\* Implement a function \`search_web(query)\` that uses an API or simple HTTP GET to a search engine and returns a result summary. Parsing HTML can be basic (e.g., use regex or Python’s \`requests\` + \`BeautifulSoup\` to extract the first result’s title and snippet). Focus on getting a concise answer. Keep this function asynchronous or separate thread if possible, to not freeze the main loop during search.  
\- \*\*CommandModule:\*\* Define a list of allowed commands (like \`open_app(name)\`, \`create_file(path)\`, \`set_reminder(time, message)\`, etc.). Each command function should handle the action using OS libraries (e.g., \`subprocess.Popen\` for launching apps, Python file I/O for file operations, scheduling for reminders). Before executing a destructive command (delete file, etc.), or any system-wide change, include a step to confirm with the user.  
\- \*\*Security Implementation:\*\* In \`NovaCore\`, intercept any function that attempts a write operation:  
\- For example, a generic method \`request_admin(permission_desc)\` that prints a prompt like “Nova requires admin rights to {permission_desc}. Continue? (y/n)” and waits for user input. Only proceed if user consents.  
\- Alternatively, run Nova with standard rights and rely on OS UAC for certain actions (like trying to write to protected directories). But the software check above will make behavior explicit.  
\- \*\*Main Loop (NovaCore):\*\* Pseudo-code structure:  
\`\`\`python  
while True:  
user_input = get_user_input() # from console or GUI  
intent, entities = ConversationModule.interpret(user_input)  
if intent == COMMAND:  
cmd, params = parse_command(entities)  
\# Confirm if needed:  
if CommandModule.requires_admin(cmd):  
confirm = prompt_user(f"Allow Nova to execute '{cmd}'?")  
if not confirm:  
print("Action cancelled.")  
continue  
result = CommandModule.execute(cmd, params)  
print(result.message) # feedback to user  
MemoryModule.log_interaction(user_input, result) # log what happened  
elif intent == QUESTION:  
answer = None  
if MemoryModule.has_answer(user_input):  
answer = MemoryModule.get_answer(user_input)  
if not answer:  
answer = InternetModule.search_web(user_input)  
MemoryModule.store_fact(user_input, answer)  
response = ConversationModule.format_answer(answer)  
print(response)  
MemoryModule.log_interaction(user_input, response)  
elif intent == CHAT:  
response = ConversationModule.generate_reply(user_input, context=MemoryModule.recent_chat())  
print(response)  
MemoryModule.log_interaction(user_input, response)  
\# end loop  
\`\`\`  
This is a simplified sketch. In implementation, handle exceptions, add timeouts for web search, etc.  
\- \*\*Learning & Improvement:\*\* After each interaction, Nova can quietly update her memory. For example, if a user corrects Nova (“No, that’s wrong, it’s actually XYZ”), Nova should adjust her stored fact for next time. Design \`MemoryModule.update_fact(old, new)\` for such cases. Additionally, consider running a periodic learning task (maybe a separate thread or invoked manually) where Nova processes the day’s conversations and researches topics she didn’t know well.  
\- \*\*Logging:\*\* Maintain logs of conversations and actions (e.g., \`nova.log\` file) for debugging and for Nova’s own review if needed. This can help in manually supervising Nova’s behavior during development.  
<br/>\## Expected Files/Structure:

C:\\Nova\\ ├── nova_core.py # Main loop and integration of modules ├── memory_module.py # MemoryModule class ├── internet_module.py # InternetModule class ├── conversation_module.py # ConversationModule class ├── command_module.py # CommandModule class └── data\\ ├── memory.db or memory.json # Nova’s persistent memory storage └── config.ini (optional) # configuration or API keys, etc.

(\*The above is a suggestion; you can structure it as packages or classes as appropriate.\*)  
<br/>\## Instructions for Copilot:  
1\. \*\*Set up project structure\*\* as described above, creating the initial Python files and classes for each module with stub methods.  
2\. \*\*Implement the MemoryModule\*\* with basic save/retrieve functionality using JSON or a simple database.  
3\. \*\*Implement the InternetModule\*\* using Python’s \`requests\` (and \`bs4\` if needed) to perform a web search and parse results.  
4\. \*\*Implement the ConversationModule\*\* with an \`interpret\` method for intent detection (use simple keyword logic) and placeholder \`format_answer\` and \`generate_reply\` methods for now.  
5\. \*\*Implement the CommandModule\*\* with a couple of example commands (e.g., open a website, create a file) and include the \`requires_admin\` logic for those that need it.  
6\. \*\*Implement nova_core.py\*\* to tie everything together in a loop as shown in pseudo-code, handling user input and module interactions.  
7\. \*\*Ensure each action is logged\*\* and that admin-required actions ask for confirmation.  
8\. \*\*Test\*\* the flow with a few example inputs to verify Nova responds or acts as intended.  
<br/>\*Begin coding with these specifications in mind. Use clear, commented code so the logic is easy to follow. Let’s build Nova!\*

This prompt provides the blueprint for Nova. It should guide GitHub Copilot to generate the initial codebase, creating the classes and main loop accordingly. You can then iterate on the generated code, refining each part of Nova’s functionality. Good luck building Nova! 🎉
